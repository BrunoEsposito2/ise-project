# ISE Project

This repository contains a collection of source code files from various frameworks for developing multi-agent generative agent systems.

## Contents

Each source file within this repository represents a version of the official code of the respective framework. The code has been annotated to highlight parallels, differences and similarities with the constructs of A&A/CArtAgO (e.g. artefacts, operations, observable properties) and Moise (e.g. roles, missions, organisational schemes, communication protocols).

### Included Frameworks

* **AutoGen**: Analysis of group management, coordination and mediation (`BaseGroupChat.py`, `BaseGroupChatManager.py`, `UserProxyAgent.py`).
* **CAMEL**: Analysis of the hierarchical organisational structure (`Workforce.py`).
* **Eclipse LMOS / ARC**: Analysis of the integration between agents and functional artefacts (`productsearch.agent.kts`, `ProductSearch.kt`).
* **CArtAgO**: A reference example of a coordination artefact (`MeetingRoomArtifact.java`).
